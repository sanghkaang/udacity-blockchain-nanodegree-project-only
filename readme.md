# Project 5: Decentralized Star Notary Project

For this project, you will create a DApp by adding functionality to your smart contract and deploy it on the public testnet. To do so, you'll employ your blockchain identity to secure digital assets on the Ethereum platform using a smart contract. You will get to practice your knowledge of the basics of Solidity.

## Key Information

- Transaction hash
- star tokenId
- contract hash:

Submit Transaction hash, star tokenId, contract hash, and contract address
Provide a document with your project submission that includes the transaction hash for the new star, star tokenId, contract hash and contract address.

Document for your project must be in either ".txt" or ".md" format.

Hint: You can view and verify a Transaction hash and Contract hash using a blockchain explorer (e.g. Etherscan).
